        <h1>Design Concept</h1>

        <h2>CROSSFIRE</h2>
        <p>
            The CROSSFIRE system operates by transmitting the rotating middle shaft torque from a electric-powered motor and gearbox to cam rotation. The cam action makes the lubricated metal surfaces to slide with each other and cause the back and forth movement of the 4 shafts. The pump heads are connected to the CROSSFIRE through the shafts.
        </p>

        <h2>Pumping Action</h2>
        <p>
            The pumping action of the pump is similar to a typical double diaphragm pumps, which uses a combination of reciprocating diaphragm and check valves on either side of the pump to create flow. The exception is that this pump consists of 4 pump heads, instead of 2, and the diaphragm reciprocating movement is govern by the shafts attached to the CROSSFIRE, instead of a single shaft powered by either by pneumatics or electric. In other words, in a full cycle, 4 diaphragms are running to pump desired fluid.
        </p>

        <h2>Pump Head</h2>
        <p>
            The uniquely constructed pump heads are designed to achieve well maintainability, easy to replicate and build.
        </p>
        <li>Large washers are held in between the diaphragm by sealing bolt to provide much better seal and stiffness </li>
        <li>Check valves are not embedded within the diaphragm head cases to enhance machinability and cost reduction. Thread connections for external check valve are used instead</li>
        <li>PTFE diaphragm itself act as the sealing element</li>
