        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            With the increase of worrying environmental concern over the oil and gas industry particularly in Alberta, an initiative need to be taken to reduce harmful gas emissions. Produced natural gasses are being used to power air-operated diaphragm pumps, which run continuously on-site and emitted the unburned gas to the atmosphere. Thus, contribute to climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
            An alternative to that is by using a uniquely designed, low cost 4-heads diaphragm pumps, connected to a CROSSFIRE system. The pump will ultimately run with much lower power draw and higher efficiency compared to similar pumps. This can be achieved from smoothing the torque curve by using 4-heads diaphragm pump operating at the same time.
        </p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>CROSSFIRE System</h2>
        <p>
            The CROSSFIRE is a patented ultra-low power common platform with 4-piston cam-driven system that can be configured for powering reciprocating pumps and compressors. Key advantages of the Canadian designed CROSSFIRE technology include:
        </p>
        <li>Developed Green Technology – reduce methane emissions at well head</li>
        <li>Cost effective and energy efficient </li>
        <li>CSA approved to Class 1 Div. 1 and Class 1 Div. 2 – hazardous area standards</li>
        <li>Easily monitored and controlled using CROSSFIRE computer software and mobile apps</li>

        <h2>Glycol Circulation Pump</h2>
        <p>
            In oil and gas industry, glycol pumps used in gas dehydration and pipeline heat tracing. Commonly, these pumps are powered with produced natural gas, which is then vented to atmosphere, thus rising environmental concern. Even tough electrically-powered pumps also being used by some companies, the CROSSFIRE system is potentially able to get the same work done with much less power draw.
